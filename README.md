David: Compared popularity between fast food and dine in restaurants with Yelp Fusion API and yFinance. I categorized each restaurant by fast food or dine in prior to making comparisons. I found the average Yelp rating for each popular chain restaurant along with the annual revenue for the year 2022. I then tested the correlation between annual revenue and yelp reviews which returned a correlation coefficient of -0.54 signifying negative correlation. This shows that customers favor convenience over quality.

Alex: With regards to trends in delivery companies, the relationship between company annual revenue over years shows a clear positive correlation. Calculating for the correlation coefficient of each company showed that each company had a coefficient above .9 reflecting the clear demand and engagement with these services despite the price increase. It was interesting to see that although the age of consumers primarily lies within the 18-34 year old range, there was a more uniform user age for mealkit services than delivery services. Mealkit services were also preferred by females, where as delivery services were more evenly split, with the exception of DeliveryHero. This outlier is likely due to the fact that DeliveryHero does not operatre in the US, and cultural differences in the other regions may affect the gender distribution of their users.
