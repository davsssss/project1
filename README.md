David: Compared popularity between fast food and dine in restauraunts with Yelp Fusion API and yFinance. I categorized each restaurant by fast food or dine in prior to making comparisons. I found the average Yelp rating for each popular chain restaurant along with the annual revenue for the year 2022. I then tested the correlation between annual revenue and yelp reviews which returned a correlation coefficient of -0.54 signifying negative correlation.
